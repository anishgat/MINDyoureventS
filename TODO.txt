Goal: Build CRUD event signup app (Next.js + TS frontend, Express + Firebase backend)

TODO
1) Confirm monorepo structure and tooling
   - Use /frontend and /backend folders.
   - Document run/test commands for each package.
   - Add env var templates for frontend and backend.

2) Frontend setup first (Next.js + TypeScript)
   - App structure with pages: Login, Event Dashboard, Create Event.
   - Use dummy in-memory data and mocks for events/signups until backend is ready.
   - API client abstraction that can swap from mock to real endpoints later.

3) Event Dashboard UI
   - Main view toggle: calendar month view vs chronological list view.
   - Calendar view: render event tags inside date cells.
   - List view: expandable event cards (collapsed: image, name, date, time, location; expanded: full details).
   - Secondary view: list of signed-up events for current user.

4) Create Event page (admin-only)
   - Form with validation; submit to mock create event.
   - Route guard + redirect if not admin (mocked role for now).

5) Auth + roles
   - Frontend login page + session handling (mocked role/user at first).
   - Decide auth mechanism (Firebase Auth recommended) and token verification in backend.
   - Store user role (admin vs participant/volunteer) and enforce RBAC.

6) Define data model + API contract
   - Firestore collections: events, signups (link userId <-> eventId), users (role).
   - Event fields: title, description, date, startTime, endTime, location, imageUrl, capacity, createdBy, createdAt.
   - Signups: eventId, userId, role (participant/volunteer), createdAt.
   - API endpoints: create/list/get/update/delete events; signup/unsign; list user signups.

7) Backend setup (Express + Firebase Admin)
   - Initialize Express server, Firebase Admin SDK, CORS, validation, error handling.
   - Implement CRUD routes for events with role-based guards for admin.
   - Implement signup routes for authenticated users.
   - Add tests for key routes and auth/role checks.

8) Quality + docs
   - Add tests for frontend components where practical.
   - Update README with setup/run/test instructions and env vars.
